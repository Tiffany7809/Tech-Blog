  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This is a full stack application, a blog that users can post and view others post as well as edit and delete post is so desired


  Through making this application I learned how to use handlebars, the MVC set up and how to connect a front end application to a database.

  I had a hard time getting this application deployed to heroku, that was the biggest challenge.
